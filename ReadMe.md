#Personal Portfolio (First Project)



This is my very first attempt at creating a portfolio website using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  

The goal of this project is to practice the fundamentals of web development while experimenting with layout, styling, and responsive design.



Although the design is not fully original — as I took inspiration from existing templates and adapted them with my own code — this project represents an important step in my learning journey. I am aware that it still has many limitations, but I see it as a starting point to grow and improve.
